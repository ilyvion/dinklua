Scripts to highlight:
- Cutscene scripts -- Using _cutscene.lua (Examples: s1-wiz, s2-cave2)
- Shop scripts -- Using _items.lua (Examples: s2-healp, s2-out)
- Because choice menus are objects and conditions are proper boolean expressions,
  you can do much more advanced conditions for them, like *OR* instead of *AND*
  among others.

Things to point out:
- Screenlock replaced by lock_screen(), unlock_screen() and is_screen_locked()
- Scripts are interrupted when a new function is called by the engine. As such,
  using loops like `while true` within a script is perfectly fine
  (examples: s2-man2, s2-wench; `mainloop()`) as long as there's a yielding
  function call in there somewhere, such as `say_stop` or `wait`.
- Because of the `volatile` global, we can avoid needing weird "temporary"
  global variables like the `temp#hold` ones.
